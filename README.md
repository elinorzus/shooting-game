# Unity Shooting Game

This game is my first project in Unity. A character with a gun moves along the roof of the building and shoots at targets.

It has the following features:

- The character moves around the area and can also climb stairs. 
- The player can shoot at the target. And when he shoots at the traget, the target's health gets smaller.
- Also, the target appears when the character presses a special green button.
- The button text only appears when the character approaches a certain distance.
- Every target has its own health bar.
- UI with continue and exit buttons, including the keyboard support.
